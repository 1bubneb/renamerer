# renamerer
ruby script to rename things wow!

I use this to rename things that I download from places to extract 'useless'
that some files have in brackets in the filenames so names are more consistent
and can be more easily changed to meet my personal filenaming conventions

also I'm tried of not always having `rename`/`prename` 
(from Perl 5.x File::rename), on every system that I  used

** USAGE **
`renamerer [list o' files to rename]`
`renamerer [path/to/files/*]` *yay globbing!*
